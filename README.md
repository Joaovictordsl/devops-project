# DevOps Lab - (Linux/bash, AWS, CI/CD, Terraform)

### This repository is to practice the fundamentals of DevOps

First and foremost what is a Container?

Well, a container is basically an isolated process that its running. 

### What does that even mean?

Well, different than a VM, that simulate and built an entire machine from zero - OS, Kernel, CPU - 
a container shares the host machine's kernel. But why tho?

Its way lighter to have your whole code, packages, and your entire application that can run everywhere and uses the host machine's CPU and Kernel, than having to create a new one from zero, just to run an application.
